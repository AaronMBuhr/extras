# LogZilla Dashboards

# Format
LogZilla Dashboards are stored in standard JSON format. As of `v5.72.1`, dashboards may be imported and exported from the command line, for example:

Import

	~logzilla/src/bin/lz5dashboards import -I mydashboards.json

Export
---
	~logzilla/src/bin/lz5dashboards export -O mydashboards.json


Import/Export from the UI

LogZilla version > `5.74` can do the same import and export directly from the UI.

# Repository
The dashboards found here are either contributed by us or the community, they come with no warranty and should not be considered production quality unless you have personally tested and approved them in your environment.
